Building the code
-----------------

### For Development

To build the code for development, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) or [io.js](https://iojs.org/en/index.html) is installed.
2. Execute the following command. This will install all the dependencies and also start a server which reloads the page whenever any files change.

   ```shell
   npm run build:dev
   ```

3. If your code is already build use ```npm run serve``` to start the development server.
